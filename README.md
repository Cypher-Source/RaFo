# RaFo

**RaFo** is a microblogging application for design lovers which is currently in development mode.

## What technology did we used?

Ionic v4 is used to develop this application. It's an hybrid application where we can take builds for Android, iOS and Web. We can use this application as PWA too!

## What Color Schemes did we used?

There are two color modes in this application, one is `light theme` and another one is `dark theme`.

### Light theme

Colors can be accessed in `css` by using `var` keyword. For example,

`background-color: var(--ion-color-<color_name>);`

`color_name`'s are listed below.

- `primary` - Pink (#FF4D85)

- `secondary` - Baby Pink (#FFB6C1)

- `tertiary` - Dark Mode (small text) (#C4C4C4)

- `success` - Change button (#2BB71E)

- `warning` - Small font text (#979797)

- `danger` - Cancel Button (#FA0606)

- `dark` - Large font text (#2F2F2F)

- `medium` - Dark Mode (Large Text) (#F0F0F0)

- `light` - Background color (#FEFEFE)

- `white` - Pure white (#FFFFFF)
